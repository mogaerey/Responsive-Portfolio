                Travel fanatic. Foodie.. coffee ninja.. baker. Hip-Hop junkie. Unapologetic underdog advocate. Of course, there is more to what makes me than this, but 
                these are a pretty solid start! It starts with being my mother’s first child and my father’s last (that makes me the oldest and youngest, depending on which 
                parent I was with). During the middle of my kindergarten school year, I moved to live with my uncle and three cousins (who became like brothers to me more 
                than cousins).  My uncle used to tell everyone he became friends with my chopstick story. He thought I was staring at people in the restaurant until he noticed
                 I wasn’t watching them because they were different, I was watching them to learn how to use chopsticks.  That may be the beginning of my love of learning about 
                 different cultures. Through learning of other cultures, it developed my passion of loving to help others.

                After graduating High School, I spent time traveling. I learned more about other cultures, other relatives, and more about myself. I moved to Texas during the 
                summer of 2016 to get to know about the other branches on my family tree. I then enrolled myself in TCC’s Programming course. Through that course, I discovered my new interest in Security.

                    Through TekSystems Launchpad Program, I have the opportunity to learn full stack development. Once I complete the program I am hoping to work with the
                    Security team to learn how to protect companies and people from malicious acts.
